1. **Name:** add an convenient and meaningful name for image size. You can call the image size by this name later.
2. **Width:** set image width in pixels (don't need add `px` at the end).
3. **Height:** set image height in pixels (don't need add `px` at the end).
4. **Cropping:** select cropping option between *Hard* and *Soft*.

After setting all the above mentioned fields click on the **Add New Size** and then click on **Save** button at the top.
